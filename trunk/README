This is the installation kit for the AO Supervisor software.

The installation kit is made up of two compressed tar files:

    AoSup_YYYY-MM-DD.tgz and AoConf_YYYY-MM-DD.tgz

The first one includes all the source tree to build the
Supervisor executables.The seconds holds configuration files.

The AO supervisor will run as a plain user, provided with sudo
privileges as root (needed only for installation) and is to be 
installed from the same user.


INSTALLATION

Login as the AO Supervisor plain user and do the following:

1. Extract the AoSup tar file into a clean directory (source directory).

2. Execute the prepare procedure:

   python prepare.py

   Be ready to provide the required path for the installation home
   directory and for the log home directory.

   As a result, the startup shell procedure file adopt_environment.sh 
   and the runtime directories are created.

   You may need to edit the adopt_environment.sh file to select the proper
   definition for the path to the QT library (see the comments into the
   file for the details).

   NOTE: if something fails while creating directories (e.g.: because
   the user has no privileges to create them) you must have the sysadmin
   provide the required privileges and rerun prepare.py.

3. Copy the file adopt_environment.sh in your home directory and provide
   so that it is executed whenever you login.

4. Logout from the account, login again and verify that the environment 
   variables are correctly defined.

5. Do: "cd $ADOPT_ROOT" and extract the AoConf tar file onto that
   directory.

6. Do: "cd $ADOPT_SOURCE/contrib" and execute:

      make
      sudo make install

7. Go back to $ADOPT_SOURCE directory and execute:

      make
      make install


Congratulations! You've a freshly made AO Supervisor installation. The 
source directory can now be deleted, if you want, and the $ADOPT_SOURCE
definition removed from ~/adopt_environment.sh.
