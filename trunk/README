This is the installation kit for the AO Supervisor software.


There are two methods for installation: from tarballs or from
an svn checkout.

TARBALL CONTENTS

The installation kit is made up of two tarballs:

    AoSup_YYYY-MM-DD.tgz and AoConf_YYYY-MM-DD.tgz

The first one includes all the source tree to build the
Supervisor executables.The seconds holds configuration 
and calibration files.

The AO supervisor will run as a plain user, provided with sudo
privileges as root (needed only for installation) and is to be 
installed from the same user.

3rd PARTY LIBRARIES
You need oaa_lib to be installed in the idl path directory. Download it from Arcetri website

INSTALLATION

Login as the AO Supervisor plain user and do the following:

1. TARBALL: Extract the AoSup tar file into a clean directory 
    (source directory).

   or

   SVN CO: Checkout a fresh source tree from the SVN repository into
           a clean directory (source directory).
   SVN CO: remember to check out the calibration data if needed:
           svn co svn+ssh://username@obelix.arcetri.astro.it/4lbt/svn/AOCalib/trunk release-full-path/calib/adsec/

2. Execute the prepare procedure from the source code directory root

   python prepare.py

   Be ready to provide the required path for the installation home
   directory and for the log home directory.

   As a result, the runtime directories are created.

   Two shell scripts are also created: adopt_environment.sh and
   install_environment.sh 

   NOTE: the shell scripts are tailored for bash shell and for a CentOS
   Linux distribution.  You may need to edit the shell scripts  if you
   installation is different (see comments into the files for hints).

   NOTE: if something fails while creating directories (e.g.: because
   the user has no privileges to create them) you must ask the sysadmin
   to provide the required privileges and rerun prepare.py.

3. Copy the file adopt_environment.sh in your home directory and provide
   so that it is executed whenever you login.

4. Execute the file install_environment.sh to set up the proper environment
   for installation.

   source ./install_environment.sh

5. TARBALL: Do: "cd $ADOPT_ROOT" and extract the AoConf tar file onto that
            directory.

   SVN CO:  Do: make install-conf ; make install-calib

6. Do: "cd $ADOPT_SOURCE/contrib" and execute:

      make
      sudo make install

7. Go back to $ADOPT_SOURCE directory and execute:

      make
      make install


Congratulations! You've a freshly made AO Supervisor installation. The 
source directory can now be deleted, if you want, and the $ADOPT_SOURCE
definition removed from ~/adopt_environment.sh.


NOTE: Do not forget to redefine the run-time environment variables by
executing:

      source adopt_environment.sh
